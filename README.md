# TETRIS

This project requires Pytorch, Pygame, Numpy, and Python3 installed.

Please see the report for a description of the game classes and the Deep Q Network implementation, training, and optimization.

To train a Deep Q Network to play Tetris, cd to the directory and run Python train.py in a terminal window.

After training completes, run python tetris.py to observe the AI clear hundreds of lines and pieces.
